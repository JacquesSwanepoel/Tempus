# Tempus 2022
An fps with an ASCII based rendering style.

I saw an example of an ASCII shader online, and it inspired me to make a game around it. Later on I thought to also add a time stop mechanic, hence the name Tempus.

I am really proud of how the shader turned out, I remember testing different character and font combinations to give the results I where looking for.

This is also the project where I tried implementing complex AI, the enemies have multiple states where they can search for, persue and attack the player based on a vision cone and distance calculation.

Unfortunately I was working on this as I entered university, and my first semester subjects needed a lot of attention, so the progress on this game dried up.

Her is a screenshot of the shader in action:

I also uploaded some of the assets and a build I made. Peruse at your own leisure.
